# Evaluation of project (Task 4 ) 
This is a group task which involved myself, Talvin and Adham. The task involved us holding a training event for a client, the client, a well-established bank, wanted to make sure that all their employees were aware of the many different cyber threats that could occur within their firm. Before holding the event there was a lot of preparation that needed to be done. Planning our time and writing material that we could use, were just some tasks which we needed to do if we wanted a successful event. In this report I will be focussing on my contribution to the task and also the interpersonal skills that we displayed throughout the process of this task. 


Talvin was the team leader and he allocated the tasks between us that we needed to complete, he then gave us a deadline for when he wanted it complete. We all completed our tasks on our own to the best of our ability. If we needed assistance we could talk to each other when we were in our weekly lessons. I listed the training materials that we would be using for the event, Adham Drew a ghannt chart to show the time allocated for the preparation and Talvin used the materials I gave him to create a schedule for the day itself, this would show how the day would pan out. 


The task which I completed was to set up all the training materials that would be used for this training event. This was a vital task because we needed to have a good amount of materials to make the event run for a whole day, also we needed high quality materials to keep the attendees fully entertained throughout the whole seminar. The training materials were key to having a great event because this is how the information would be given to the employees of the client. Furthermore, I needed to prepare the training materials as soon as possible so that Talvin could plan out the schedule the day itself. I also contributed to the schedule which was the task which Talvin was doing. He was drawing a rough sketch of the timetable for the training day in one of our group meetings. Adham and myself were adding our own ideas to what we thought the timetable could look like. Overall, I thought I contributed well to the task as I did my own task to the best of my ability, and I helped contribute to the schedule where I thought I could input my ideas. 


In this task I feel we all had great interpersonal skills which really made the work flow. Communication was a very good skill which we all shared in this task, we all communicated our ideas to each other and we all understood what we needed to do to make this task a success. If Talvin thought that there was something missing in my work, he told me straight away. I then went back and looked at my work, I then improved it further. For example, when I listed all the training materials that were needed, I listed PowerPoint presentations but I didn’t exactly show what they would be. Talvin suggested making a PowerPoint presentation to exactly show what we would be displaying. This showed we had great team working skills because he was ready to give his input and responded by doing the work to much higher standard. I feel I also used my listening skills well because Talvin described a lot of information that he wanted to see in my work and I needed to fully understand what he was trying to say, so that I could improve my work to a standard that was acceptable for him.


The interpersonal skills which we all displayed were really effective. The helped make sure that the group task was up to a standard which we were all happy with. If a member of our team needed some assistance I felt I was there to support them and we all improved upon each other’s work. 


To conclude, I believe that the preparation and delivery of this task was a success. I firmly believe I contributed greatly in this task with my ideas, and I did the task which was set to me by my team leader. My interpersonal skills, such as communicating with my team and listening adherently helped our team work in a great and efficient manner. I believe this task showed us how working well in a team can help us achieve the same goal in a more effective way.



# Team Dynamics (Task 6)
A very important aspect for a team to be successful is having good team dynamics. Team dynamics impact the course of a groups conduct and execution, this usually happen without the team considering it as they naturally work well together. The team dynamics are built by the essence of the team’s work, the personalities of the individuals in the team, the working relationships they have with the other member of their group and the surroundings in which the team works in. Team dynamics can be helpful because they can bring out the best in the team and also bring out the best in each person. If the team dynamics are not taken into consideration the performance of the team might not reach its potential resulting in the task not being up to a good standard.


In our task we obtained some team dynamics that made our work flow well. Our personality styles were compatible, meaning we all knew we were going work hard and deliver the targets that were set by our team leader. We had a good working environment and the tools and technology used were helpful in completing the work and communication with each other on a daily basis. Lastly, we all understood that we all different strengths and weaknesses, this was good because by identifying the qualities we could divide the work accordingly.


Team dynamics was hugely incorporated in successfully creating a group project. We managed to build a great environment for the members to work in, we did not have any arguments with each other because our personalities were very similar and we all knew what was expected of us. We also communicated clearly and bonded throughout the process. Our team working skills were also great as we wanted to help each other as much as possible. An example of this was when I did the task that was set to me by my team leader. The task was to list all the materials and activities that would be used for the training event. The team leader looked over my work and informed me that as well as listing the materials I should evidence them as well, this is so that the accessor can clearly see what we would be using for the event day. This was a hurdle for us to overcome and our only main issue in this task. The team leader asked what he wanted from me and I did it straight away. I did it without question because after reviewing the work I knew that this would improve the standard of the work. Both team leader and I both shared the belief that it is important for the work to be of high quality. 


To conclude, I believe that the team dynamics that we all shared made this a very successful task. Our attitude to working well in a team created a good environment to do the work in. The tasks were all finished within the deadline by having a good team ethic we manged to overcome all the hurdles we faced. 

# Team roles (Task 7)
This task involved me working in a group of three to four people to complete a task. The task requires us to create a training event for client, to make their employees aware of the cyber threats that could occur within their firm. We had to prepare and plan the event well so that we deliver a great session. Our team included Talvin, who was the team leader, Adham and myself. 


Talvin was the leader who coordinated the team well and made this a successful task. As there were three tasks that needed to be completed, he suggested that one person would complete one task. This would help because we could share the workload and the work would be completed in a more efficient way. Also, by sharing the workload the quality of work will be better because that individual is only thinking about their own work and not the others. 


Talvin, talked to us about our strengths and weaknesses and from that he allocated the task. From the information I gave him, he found out that I had good researching skills. So he gave me the task of finding the training materials that we could use for the training day. I then went on a trusted search engine and looked for activities and material that would be helpful for the event. I then listed them down in a word document and sent the work to Talvin. Adham and Talvin both had great time management skills, Talvin knew that the other two tasks, creating a Gantt chart and making an event day schedule, were both time related tasks. He understood that he could split the last two tasks in whichever way he saw fit. He selected Adham to create the Gantt chart and he chose himself to do the event day schedule. The Gantt chart involved Adham detailing how the time was allocated for the preparation of this task, he also added some resources used. Adham also needed to fully explain the Gantt chart, describing how and why we planned the preparation the way we did. Talvin wanted to create the schedule for the event day, he believed that the schedule was very important for the success of the task. Talvin’s planning skills were great, he knew when it would be good to use certain activities, by him making a great schedule the event would run smoothly and the attendees would be fully focused. 


To conclude, I believe the way we planned this group task was a success. We each knew our strengths and weaknesses and we allocated the tasks accordingly. This helped make our preparation for the task a successful one. We all knew what were jobs were and we did them in an efficient manner. We even had time to receive input from our team leader if he thought that our work was not up to a good standard. From this task we found out by dividing work we can all achieve the same goal in a much better way.
